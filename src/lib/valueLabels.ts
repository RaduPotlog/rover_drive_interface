 * Ported verbatim from RaduPotlog/rover_cockpit_ros2_diagnostics

 *
 * Plain-language meaning for boolean diagnostic values whose True/False is easy to misread.
 *
 * The safety pins arrive as raw True/False, and the polarity is not obvious from the name
 * alone: "HW E-Stop user button: False" reads as "the E-Stop is off" to some people and "the
 * button is not working" to others. This spells out what each level means physically, next to
 * the raw value rather than instead of it, so the value stays copyable into a bug report.
 *
 * Keys are the exact strings rover_twist_mux's "Motion lock" diagnostic publishes (see
 * rover_twist_mux/src/infrastructure/motion_lock_node.cpp, diagnoseMotionLock()). A key that
 * is renamed there simply loses its label here - it never gets a wrong one.
